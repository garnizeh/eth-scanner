## Description

Design and implement the main structural components of the dashboard. This includes the base HTML layout, navigation menus, and the mounting points for dynamic HTMX components.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Define `layout.html` with basic meta tags, Tailwind CDN link, and HTMX script.
- [ ] Create a header/navigation bar with "Overview", "Workers", and "Settings/Logout".
- [ ] Setup a "Main Content" block where sub-pages will be rendered.
- [ ] Implement a sidebar or tabs for switching between different statistics views.
- [ ] Ensure the base layout includes the WebSocket connection logic via HTMX.

## Implementation Notes

- Use Tailwind CSS for rapid styling without a build step.
- The layout should be "Mobile First" as per the SDD.
- Use `{{ block "content" . }}{{ end }}` patterns for template inheritance.

## Testing

- Verify layout responsiveness on different screen sizes.
- Click navigation links and verify the correct templates are being loaded within the layout.
