# P09-T060: Test lease expiration and job re-assignment

**Phase:** P09 - Integration, Testing & Validation  
**Status:** Not Started  
**Priority:** High  
**Dependencies:** P04-T050  
**Estimated Effort:** Medium

---

## Description

Verify the system's re-assignment logic when a job lease expires due to a worker disconnection or failure.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Job is leased with a short TTL (e.g., 2 minutes).
- [ ] No checkpoint is received before TTL expires.
- [ ] Subsequent `POST /api/v1/jobs/lease` successfully re-assigns the expired job to a new worker.
- [ ] Job ID remains consistent after re-assignment with the same `prefix_28`.

## Implementation Notes

- Use extremely short expiration windows in the test config to avoid waiting 1 hour.

## Testing

- API test with Postman or a Go integration test simulating two workers.
