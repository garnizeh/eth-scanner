# P10-T010: Setup HTMX and Go Template infrastructure with `embed.FS`

**Phase:** P10 - Dashboard & Monitoring UI  
**Status:** Not Started  
**Priority:** High  
**Dependencies:** None  
**Estimated Effort:** Small

---

## Description

Establish the foundation for the server-side rendered UI. This includes setting up the directory structure, configuring Go's `embed` package to bundle assets, and creating the basic template rendering logic.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Create `go/internal/server/ui/` directory.
- [ ] Setup `embed.FS` to include `templates/` and `static/` subdirectories.
- [ ] Implement a `TemplateRenderer` or similar helper to load and execute templates from the embedded filesystem.
- [ ] Create a "Hello World" dashboard route in `routes.go` to verify the setup.
- [ ] Include the HTMX library script in the base layout.

## Implementation Notes

- Use `html/template` for type-safe rendering.
- Templates should be loaded once at startup for performance.
- Ensure the `embed` directive covers all necessary extensions (.html, .css, .js).

## Testing

- Start the master server and navigate to `/dashboard` (or configured UI root).
- Verify the page loads correctly and verify (using DevTools) that the source comes from the embedded filesystem.
