# Task: P06-T120 - Replace worker simulation with real job processing [IN PROGRESS]

## Description
The current PC worker implementation in `internal/worker/worker.go` successfully leases jobs from the Master API but simulates the scanning process using `time.After(2 * time.Second)`. This task involves integrating the optimized scanner logic to perform real cryptographic work, report progress accurately via checkpoints, and submit found results to the API.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Replace `time.After` simulation in `Worker.processBatch` with a call to `ScanRangeParallel`.
- [ ] Implement a mechanism for `ScanRangeParallel` to periodically report `current_nonce` and `keys_scanned` back to the `Worker`'s checkpointing goroutine (e.g., using an atomic or a progress struct).
- [ ] Ensure the worker can handle and submit results if a matching private key is found.
- [ ] Plumbing: Update `JobLease` and Master API to provide the `target_address` to workers (or hardcode a default "dead" address if not yet dynamic).
- [ ] Verify that the worker now takes a realistic amount of time to complete a batch (matching the benchmarked throughput).

## Dependencies
- P06-T100: Optimized crypto loop
- P06-T110: Benchmarks (for throughput reference)

## Technical Notes
- The worker should use `runtime.NumCPU()` (already used in `ScanRangeParallel`) to parallelize work.
- Use atomic variables in the `Worker` struct or passed to the scanner to ensure the checkpointing goroutine always has the latest progress snapshot.
- The `target_address` should ideally be `0x000000000000000000000000000000000000dEaD` as per the system design.
