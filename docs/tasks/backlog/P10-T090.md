# P10-T090: Implement "Jobs Overview" component with progress bars

**Phase:** P10 - Dashboard & Monitoring UI  
**Status:** Not Started  
**Priority:** High  
**Dependencies:** [P10-T040]  
**Estimated Effort:** Medium

---

## Description

Create the "Prefix / Macro Jobs" monitoring component. This tab shows the progress of the scanning ranges for each Ethereum prefix (`prefix_28`).

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Fetch prefix work ranges from the `jobs` table (grouped by `prefix_28`).
- [ ] Create an `Overview` section showing progress bars for each active prefix.
- [ ] Implement live progress bar updates using the WebSocket hub.
- [ ] Add columns for "Estimated Completion Time" and "Number of Workers Assigned".
- [ ] Implement clickable prefixes to see a list of individual worker ranges within that prefix.

## Implementation Notes

- Use Tailwind's CSS progress bars (`bg-blue-600 rounded-full h-2.5`).
- Calculate percentage as `(current_nonce - nonce_start) / (nonce_end - nonce_start) * 100`.
- Update the bar width using HTMX attributes from WebSocket.

## Testing

- Simulate multiple prefixes with varying progress.
- Verify progress bars move forward as workers checkpoint.
- Verify estimated time decreases as throughput increases.
