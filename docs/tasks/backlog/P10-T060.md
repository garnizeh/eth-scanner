# P10-T060: Implement "Live Throughput" chart using minimal JS (uPlot or Chart.js)

**Phase:** P10 - Dashboard & Monitoring UI  
**Status:** Not Started  
**Priority:** High  
**Dependencies:** [P10-T050]  
**Estimated Effort:** Medium

---

## Description

Add a real-time throughput chart (total keys/sec) to the dashboard overview. This will visualize the cumulative scanning power of the entire fleet over the last 5-10 minutes.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Include uPlot or Chart.js script via CDN in the layout.
- [ ] Create an `Overview` chart container in the dashboard index.
- [ ] Update the chart data points via WebSocket messages.
- [ ] Calculate the aggregate keys/second on the server before broadcasting.
- [ ] Smooth the data using a 5-second window if necessary.

## Implementation Notes

- Since HTMX is primarily for HTML swaps, use a small script to subscribe to WebSocket events and update the chart object. Alternatively, use HTMX to swap a `<script>` tag that updates the chart (less common but possible).
- Prefer uPlot for its small size and performance with real-time data.

## Testing

- Verify the chart advances periodically.
- Observe the chart responding to worker starts and stops.
- Verify memory consumption of the browser doesn't grow indefinitely.
