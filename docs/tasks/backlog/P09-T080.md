# P09-T080: Benchmark PC worker throughput (keys/sec on reference hardware)

**Phase:** P09 - Integration, Testing & Validation  
**Status:** Not Started  
**Priority:** Medium  
**Dependencies:** P06-T110  
**Estimated Effort:** Medium

---

## Description

Evaluate the performance of the PC Worker implementation on standard hardware to establish expected throughput for the Master API's dynamic batch sizing logic.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Measure throughput (keys per second per CPU core).
- [ ] Measure aggregate throughput (all cores used).
- [ ] Record results in `docs/worker-pc-benchmarks.md`.
- [ ] Update Master API defaults for PC workers if necessary.

## Implementation Notes

- Use reference hardware (e.g., standard workstation CPU) for consistent results.
- Profile `DeriveEthereumAddress` to identify any Go runtime bottlenecks.

## Testing

- Run `go test -bench . ./internal/worker/core/...`.
