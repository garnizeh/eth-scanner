# P09-T120: Load test: multiple concurrent workers (10+ workers)

**Phase:** P09 - Integration, Testing & Validation  
**Status:** Not Started  
**Priority:** Low  
**Dependencies:** P09-T050  
**Estimated Effort:** Medium

## Description

Perform a stress/load test by spinning up 10+ concurrent PC/Mock workers to ensure the Master API and SQLite handle concurrent leases/checkpoints correctly.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Create a script to spawn 10+ worker processes.
- [ ] Monitor SQLite database for any locking or performance issues.
- [ ] Verify no workers get failed lease requests due to concurrency.
- [ ] Check API response times during the load test.

## Implementation Notes

- Use multiple instances of `worker-pc` and possibly some mock scripts.
- Monitor with `top` or a logging tool.

## Testing

- Successful completion of at least 100 concurrent batches without errors.
