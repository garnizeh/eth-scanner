# P10-T080: Implement "Monthly & Lifetime" statistics views

**Phase:** P10 - Dashboard & Monitoring UI  
**Status:** Not Started  
**Priority:** Medium  
**Dependencies:** [P10-T070]  
**Estimated Effort:** Small

---

## Description

Extend the statistics views to include long-term trends (Tier 3) and lifetime rankings (Tier 4). This covers the "Worker Leaderboard" and cumulative fleet metrics.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Create templates and routes for `/dashboard/monthly` and `/dashboard/leaderboard`.
- [ ] Implement server-side queries for `worker_stats_monthly` and `worker_stats_lifetime`.
- [ ] Render the "Worker Leaderboard" table sorted by highest throughput/work volume.
- [ ] Add "Best Day" and "Best Month" records for the entire fleet.
- [ ] Ensure the views handle empty or sparse data gracefully.

## Implementation Notes

- Reuse the table styling from P10-T050.
- Lifetime stats don't require charts, just high-performance sorting and rendering.

## Testing

- Verify the leaderboard correctly calculates lifetime totals.
- Verify monthly data correctly buckets time across month boundaries.
