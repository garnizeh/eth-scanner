# P10-T110: Add responsive design using Tailwind CSS (via CDN or standalone CLI)

**Phase:** P10 - Dashboard & Monitoring UI  
**Status:** Not Started  
**Priority:** Low  
**Dependencies:** [P10-T040]  
**Estimated Effort:** Small

---

## Description

Ensure the dashboard is fully responsive and visually polished across mobile, tablet, and desktop viewports. This includes refining layouts and hiding non-critical elements on small screens.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Implement a mobile-first sidebar/menu that collapses into a "hamburger" menu.
- [ ] Set responsive column widths for lists and tables (`hidden md:table-cell`).
- [ ] Verify chart scaling on small devices.
- [ ] Optimize the login screen for mobile use.
- [ ] Use Tailwind colors consistently across all components.

## Implementation Notes

- Use standard Tailwind breakpionts (`sm`, `md`, `lg`, `xl`).
- Avoid adding a Node.js build step; continue using the Play CDN or the standalone Tailwind CLI binary if needed for production builds.

## Testing

- Use Chrome DevTools to simulate iPhone, iPad, and generic desktop resolutions.
- Verify all primary functions (overview, workers, login) are usable on a small touch screen.
