# P08-T040: Spawn Core 0 Task (xTaskCreatePinnedToCore) for Networking & Watchdog.

**Phase:** P08 - ESP32 Worker - Crypto & Computation  
**Status:** Not Started  
**Priority:** High  
**Dependencies:** P07-T040  
**Estimated Effort:** Medium

---

## Description

Set up the ESP32 to use its dual-core capabilities by spawning a dedicated task for non-computational work (WiFi, API client, and system housekeeping) on Core 0.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Create a `core0_system_task` function.
- [ ] Spawn the task using `xTaskCreatePinnedToCore` on PRO_CPU (Core 0).
- [ ] Move initialization and maintenance logic for WiFi and API client into this task.
- [ ] Verify that Core 0 remains responsive to network events and watchdog timers.

## Implementation Notes

- Refer to the Dual-Core Logic in `OVERVIEW.md`.
- Core 0 (System Core) handles everything except the computational loop.
- Use task notifications or queues for inter-task communication.

## Testing

- Monitor serial output to confirm task initialization on the correct core.
- Verify WiFi connectivity and API access can coexist with dummy work on Core 1 later.
