# P09-T070: Test checkpoint recovery (worker crashes mid-batch)

**Phase:** P09 - Integration, Testing & Validation  
**Status:** Not Started  
**Priority:** High  
**Dependencies:** P06-T080  
**Estimated Effort:** Medium

---

## Description

Perform a scenario-based test where a worker crashes mid-batch and resumes work from the last successful checkpoint saved to the Master API.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] PC worker starts, leases a job, and updates its progress checkpoint.
- [ ] PC worker service/process is killed manually or via signal.
- [ ] PC worker restarts, requests a job, and receives its own previous job if it's still processing/leased.
- [ ] PC worker resumes scanning from the last checkpointed nonce.

## Implementation Notes

- Verify that `load_checkpoint` (on PC worker if implemented) or Master API's `LeaseJob` properly handles resumption.

## Testing

- Bash script that starts/stops/restarts the worker and monitors the DB progress.
