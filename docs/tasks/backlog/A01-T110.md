## Summary

Allow the Master API to accept and distribute a list of target Ethereum addresses to workers instead of a single target address. Workers should test generated addresses against the provided list.

## Motivation

Testing multiple target addresses per prefix reduces round-trips and allows workers to scan for several addresses in one pass.

## Acceptance criteria

- Update API schema for lease responses to include an array of target addresses.
- Update client/server code paths to accept/emit the list and to validate address formats.
- Update worker scanning logic to check generated addresses against all addresses in the list.
- Add unit/integration tests for API and worker behavior (including invalid address formats).
- Document the new API field in the API docs.

## Implementation notes

- Keep backward compatibility: if a single address is provided, still populate the list with one entry.
- Use canonical hex address format prefixed with `0x` and lowercase normalization.

## Steps

1. Update API types and SQL schema if needed.
2. Modify lease handler and response struct.
3. Update worker scanning logic to test against list.
4. Add tests and documentation.
