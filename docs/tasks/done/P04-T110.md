# P04-T110: Create POST /api/v1/results handler (submit found private key)

**Phase:** P04 - Master API - Job Management (Dynamic Batching)  
**Status:** Done
**Priority:** Medium  
**Completed On:** 2026-02-15

## Summary

Implemented the results submission endpoint allowing workers to report found private keys. The handler validates input (private key length and hex, 0x-prefixed address), inserts into `results` table, and returns 201 Created with the inserted record.

## Acceptance Criteria (completed)
- [x] Handler `handleResultSubmit` implemented
- [x] Accepts POST request to `/api/v1/results`
- [x] Request body validated (worker_id, job_id, private_key, address)
- [x] Validates private key format (64 hex chars)
- [x] Validates Ethereum address format (0x + 40 hex chars)
- [x] Inserts result into `results` table (`InsertResult` SQL)
- [x] Returns 201 Created with result record on success
- [x] Returns 400 Bad Request for validation errors
- [x] Route registered in `routes.go`

## Implementation notes

- Files changed/added:
  - `go/internal/server/results.go` — new handler implementation
  - `go/internal/server/results_test.go` — unit tests (success, invalid private key, invalid address, missing worker_id, non-hex private key, non-hex address)
  - `go/internal/server/routes.go` — route registration for `/api/v1/results`
- Tests: local `go test` for server package passed for the new tests.
