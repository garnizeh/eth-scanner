# P10-T070: Implement "Daily Performance" view (Server-side rendered charts)

**Phase:** P10 - Dashboard & Monitoring UI  
**Status:** Completed  
**Priority:** High  
**Dependencies:** [P10-T040]  
**Estimated Effort:** Medium

## Description

Create the historical performance view using Tier 2 (daily) statistics. This view provides a 7-day retrospective on scanning efficiency and total volume.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Implement the server-side query to fetch `worker_stats_daily` aggregates.
- [x] Create the `/dashboard/daily` route and template.
- [x] Render a bar or line chart showing keys scanned per day for the last week.
- [x] Add a summary table showing "Total Keys Scanned (7 days)" and "Avg Throughput (7 days)".
- [x] Implement per-worker daily charts in the worker detail view (see P10-T100).

## Implementation Notes

- This view is mostly server-side rendered (SSR) with uPlot for charting.
- Chart data is baked into the HTML template as a JSON-compatible data block.
- Supports filtering by `worker_id` for per-worker historical views.
- Handles both aggregated historical data (`worker_stats_daily`) and recent raw data (`worker_history`).
- Integrated with the worker list for easy access to per-worker stats.

## Testing

- Select a worker and verify their daily performance appears.
- Compare dashboard values against the matching `GET /api/v1/stats/daily` JSON results.
