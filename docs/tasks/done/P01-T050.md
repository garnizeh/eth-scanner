# P01-T050: Create scripts/init-db.sh Script

**Phase:** P01 - Project Foundation & Setup  
**Status:** Done  
**Priority:** Medium  
**Dependencies:** None  
**Estimated Effort:** Small (< 45 minutes)

## Resolution

This task has been closed without implementing `scripts/init-db.sh`.

Decision: instead of a standalone shell script, the project will use the Go migration library `goose` to apply database migrations automatically when the application starts. Using `goose` centralizes schema management, supports versioned migrations, and avoids duplicating initialization logic in both a script and the application.

Key points:
- Migrations are applied by the application at startup (master API / worker as appropriate) using `goose`.
- Migration files should be placed in the repository's migrations directory (e.g. `go/migrations` or the path configured in the app). See the master service for the configured location.
- CI and local development should rely on the app to apply migrations; for one-off migration tasks the `goose` CLI can be used per the project's documentation.

## Acceptance Criteria (updated)

- [x] Replace `scripts/init-db.sh` approach with `goose`-based migrations
- [x] Documented that migrations are applied by the app on startup (see above)
- [x] Task moved to `docs/tasks/done/`

## Notes

- If a simple initialization script is still desired (for CI or non-Go consumers), we can add a lightweight wrapper that invokes the `goose` CLI; this is considered out of scope for this task.
- Ensure the master API startup sequence applies migrations early (before accepting requests) and that all timestamps use UTC.

- Project migration decision: use `goose` for schema management and migrations applied at app startup.
