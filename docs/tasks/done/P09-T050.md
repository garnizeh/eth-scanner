# P09-T050: Write integration test: PC worker + Master API (full batch cycle)

**Phase:** P09 - Integration, Testing & Validation  
**Status:** Completed
**Priority:** High  
**Dependencies:** P06-T080, P04-T050  
**Estimated Effort:** Medium

## Description

Perform a full end-to-end test of the Go Master API integrated with the PC Worker implementation.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Master API is running with a test SQLite database.
- [x] PC Worker successfully leases a job via `POST /api/v1/jobs/lease`.
- [x] PC Worker updates its status via `PATCH /api/v1/jobs/{id}/checkpoint`.
- [x] PC Worker completes its job via `POST /api/v1/jobs/{id}/complete`.

## Implementation Notes

- Use a real Master API server instance and at least one real PC Worker process.
- Configure Worker with tiny batch sizes to verify cycle quickly.

## Testing

- Automated script or Go test that spawns both components and monitors the DB status.
