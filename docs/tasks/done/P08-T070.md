# P08-T070: Spawn Core 1 Task with highest priority for the computational hot loop.

**Phase:** P08 - ESP32 Worker - Crypto & Computation  
**Status:** Not Started  
**Priority:** High  
**Dependencies:** P08-T030  
**Estimated Effort:** Medium

---

## Description

Setup the high-priority computational task on Core 1 that will execute the cryptographic hot loop. This task should be dedicated 100% to the scanning process.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Create a `core1_worker_task` function.
- [ ] Spawn the task using `xTaskCreatePinnedToCore` on APP_CPU (Core 1).
- [ ] Set task priority to the highest possible (e.g., `configMAX_PRIORITIES - 1`).
- [ ] Implement a loop that waits for a task notification before starting work.

## Implementation Notes

- Refer to `docs/architecture/system-design-document.md` section 3.A for worker specifications.
- Use `StaticTask_t` for the worker task to avoid heap churn (P08-T110 will fully implement this).
- Do not make any network calls or NVS writes in this task.

## Testing

- Monitor serial output to confirm Core 1 initialization.
- Use `vTaskGetRunTimeStats` (if possible) to verify Core 1 usage is at 100% when working.
