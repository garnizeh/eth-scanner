# P10-T120: Implement "Error Log" and alert notifications

**Phase:** P10 - Dashboard & Monitoring UI  
**Status:** In Progress
**Priority:** Medium  
**Dependencies:** [P10-T050]  
**Estimated Effort:** Medium

---

## Description

Add a real-time error monitoring panel and "toast" style notifications for critical events, such as a worker losing connection or an invalid checkpoint submission.

## Current Status & Blockers

- [ ] **BLOCKER:** Auto-close and Manual close on toasts are NOT working.
- [ ] Notifications appear but remain permanently on the screen, cluttering the UI.
- [ ] Multiple attempts were made using JavaScript `setTimeout`, `MutationObserver`, and CSS `onanimationend`, but the toasts persist due to internal HTMX/WS update logic or DOM state issues.
- [ ] The feature is considered "NOT EXECUTED" as it fails the core UX requirement of being non-persistent.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Create a "Recent Errors" sidebar or sub-tab.
- [x] Broadcast errors via the WebSocket hub when they occur in the API handlers.
- [ ] Use a toast/alert notification component for high-severity issues (Persistent bug: they don't close).
- [x] Log errors on the dashboard with a timestamp and worker ID.
- [x] Add a "Clear Log" button (client-side only or persisted).

## Implementation Notes

- Use the HTMX "out-of-band" (OOB) swap feature to push notification HTML into a fixed container from any WebSocket message.
- Style alerts using standard Tailwind alert colors (`bg-red-500`, `bg-yellow-500`).

## Testing

- Simulate worker errors (e.g., malformed JSON).
- Verify the alert appears instantly in the browser.
- Verify the log persists as long as the page is not refreshed.
