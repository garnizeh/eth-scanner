## Description

Add a real-time error monitoring panel and "toast" style notifications for critical events, such as a worker losing connection or an invalid checkpoint submission.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Create a "Recent Errors" sidebar or sub-tab.
- [ ] Broadcast errors via the WebSocket hub when they occur in the API handlers.
- [ ] Use a toast/alert notification component for high-severity issues.
- [ ] Log errors on the dashboard with a timestamp and worker ID.
- [ ] Add a "Clear Log" button (client-side only or persisted).

## Implementation Notes

- Use the HTMX "out-of-band" (OOB) swap feature to push notification HTML into a fixed container from any WebSocket message.
- Style alerts using standard Tailwind alert colors (`bg-red-500`, `bg-yellow-500`).

## Testing

- Simulate worker errors (e.g., malformed JSON).
- Verify the alert appears instantly in the browser.
- Verify the log persists as long as the page is not refreshed.
