# P09-T020: Write unit tests for internal/worker/crypto.go

**Phase:** P09 - Integration, Testing & Validation  
**Status:** Completed
**Priority:** High  
**Dependencies:** P06-T020  
**Estimated Effort:** Medium

---

## Description

Write comprehensive unit tests for the PC worker's cryptographic functions located in `internal/worker/crypto.go`.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Test `DeriveEthereumAddress` with known test vectors.
- [x] Test key construction (`prefix_28` + nonce).
- [x] Test edge cases (all zeros, all ones, rollover).

## Implementation Notes

- Use standard Ethereum test vectors for validation.

## Testing

- Run `go test ./internal/worker/...` and verify 100% pass rate.
