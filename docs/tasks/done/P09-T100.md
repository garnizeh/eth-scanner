# P09-T100: Test ESP32 NVS checkpoint recovery on power loss

**Phase:** P09 - Integration, Testing & Validation  
**Status:** Completed  
**Priority:** High  
**Dependencies:** P08-T120  
**Estimated Effort:** Medium

---

## Description

Verify the ESP32 worker can recover from a hardware reset, power loss, or crash by reading its last checkpoint from the Non-Volatile Storage (NVS).

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Job is leased and scanning starts on the ESP32.
- [x] ESP32 saves at least one checkpoint to NVS locally.
- [x] ESP32 is reset manually via the "EN" button.
- [x] ESP32 re-loads the state from NVS on reboot and continues scanning from the saved nonce.

## Implementation Notes

- Use `load_checkpoint` logic implemented in Phase 07.
- Verify through serial logs for "Loaded checkpoint from NVS: starting from nonce 1234..."

## Testing

- Physical power-cycle or reset button test.
