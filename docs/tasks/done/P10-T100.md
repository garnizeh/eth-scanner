# P10-T100: Implement "Worker Detail" page (SSR fragment)

**Phase:** P10 - Dashboard & Monitoring UI  
**Status:** Completed  
**Priority:** Medium  
**Dependencies:** [P10-T070]  
**Estimated Effort:** Medium

---

## Description

Create a detailed profile page for each worker. This page aggregates real-time status with historical performance (Daily/Monthly) for a specific worker ID.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Create route `/dashboard/workers/{worker_id}`.
- [x] Render worker meta-data (ID, Version, OS/HW Type).
- [x] Display a worker-specific throughput real-time chart.
- [x] Display historical volume bar chart (7 days).
- [x] Add a "Recent Log" or "Latest Checkpoints" list for that specific worker.
- [x] Allow clicking a worker in the table (P10-T050) to open this view.

## Implementation Notes

- Use HTMX to load this view into the main content block without a full page refresh.
- Parameterize the common chart templates (P10-T070) to work with a single worker's data.

## Testing

- Access several worker detail pages.
- Verify the worker ID in the URL matches the data shown.
- Verify real-time updates still work within the detail view.
