# P07-T010: Initialize PlatformIO project with ESP-IDF framework — Completed

**Phase:** P07 - ESP32 Worker - Core Infrastructure  
**Status:** Completed  
**Priority:** High  
**Dependencies:** None  
**Estimated Effort:** Small

---

## Summary

Implemented the PlatformIO project skeleton and verified the minimal `app_main()` exists in `esp32/src/main.c`. The project was initialized under `esp32/` and builds with PlatformIO (project previously created by the user; adjusted `main.c` to match the task requirements).

## Changes made

- Updated `esp32/src/main.c` to include ESP-IDF headers and use `ESP_LOGI` with a background loop (task-compliant skeleton).
- Confirmed `esp32/platformio.ini` present and environment configured for ESP-IDF.

## Verification

- `esp32/src/main.c` now logs: "EthScanner ESP32 Worker starting..." at startup and uses `vTaskDelay(pdMS_TO_TICKS(1000))` in the main loop.
- Project builds in local environment (PlatformIO tasks executed by user workspace).

## Notes

- Next task: `P07-T020` (create `Kconfig.projbuild`) — work in progress.
