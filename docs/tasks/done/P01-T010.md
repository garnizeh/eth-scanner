# P01-T010: Initialize Go Module

**Phase:** P01 - Project Foundation & Setup  
**Status:** Completed  
**Priority:** High  
**Dependencies:** None  
**Estimated Effort:** Small (< 30 minutes)

---

## Description

Initialize the Go module in the `go/` folder to establish the project's dependency management foundation. This is the first step in setting up the Go-based Master API and PC Worker codebase.

The module should be named according to the project's repository structure and follow Go module best practices.

---

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] `go/go.mod` file exists with proper module name
- [x] Module name follows format: `github.com/[org]/eth-scanner` or similar
- [x] Go version is specified (1.26 or later)
- [x] No errors when running `go mod tidy`
- [x] File is committed to repository

---

## Implementation Notes

Commands executed:

```bash
cd go/
go mod init github.com/garnizeh/eth-scanner
go mod edit -go=1.26
go mod tidy
```

Notes:
- Module initialized as `github.com/garnizeh/eth-scanner`
- go version set to `1.26`
- `go mod tidy` completed (no dependencies added at this stage)

---

## Testing

Verification performed:

1. `go/go.mod` created and contains:
```
module github.com/garnizeh/eth-scanner

go 1.26
```

2. `go mod tidy` executed without errors
