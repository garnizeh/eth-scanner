# P08-T090: Implement binary address comparison using memcmp for zero-overhead validation.

**Phase:** P08 - ESP32 Worker - Crypto & Computation  
**Status:** Not Started  
**Priority:** High  
**Dependencies:** P08-T080  
**Estimated Effort:** Small

## Description

Implement the logic to check if the derived Ethereum address matches the target search address. Use binary comparison (`memcmp`) instead of hex string comparison for efficiency.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Implement `check_address(derived, target)` using `memcmp`.
- [ ] Ensure the target address is stored and compared in its 20-byte binary form.
- [ ] Validated to correctly identify a match when it occurs.

## Implementation Notes

- Target address is 20 bytes.
- `memcmp` is significantly faster than string operations.
- This comparison happens once for every key generated, so efficiency is paramount.

## Testing

- Mock a match by setting the target address to a known private key's address and verify it's found.
- Log match discovery and current nonce.
