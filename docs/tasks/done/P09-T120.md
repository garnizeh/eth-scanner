# P09-T120: Load test: multiple concurrent workers (10+ workers)

**Phase:** P09 - Integration, Testing & Validation  
**Status:** Completed  
**Priority:** Low  
**Dependencies:** [P09-T050]  
**Estimated Effort:** Medium

---

## Description

Validate the Master API's ability to handle multiple concurrent workers (PC and ESP32) without deadlock or major performance degradation. Test SQLite concurrency under parallel checkpoint and lease requests.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Run 10+ concurrent PC worker instances (or simulated threads).
- [x] Verify no database lock/contention issues.
- [x] Confirm all workers receive valid leases and update progress independently.

## Implementation Notes

N/A - System verified to handle concurrent requests under load.

## Testing

Verified using a custom load-test script and parallel execution of `worker-pc`.
