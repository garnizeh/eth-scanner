# P08-T100: Implement result submission (Core 1 notifies Core 0 via FreeRTOS Queue).

**Phase:** P08 - ESP32 Worker - Crypto & Computation  
**Status:** Not Started  
**Priority:** High  
**Dependencies:** P08-T090  
**Estimated Effort:** Medium

---

## Description

Implement the mechanism for Core 1 to signal Core 0 upon finding a matching private key. Core 0 will then be responsible for the network request to submit the result to the Master API.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Create a FreeRTOS queue for found results.
- [ ] Core 1 pushes the successful private key into the queue when `check_address` succeeds.
- [ ] Core 0 listens for data in the queue and calls `submit_result` via `api_client`.
- [ ] Core 1 can continue scanning (in case multiple matches are possible, or for multi-target systems in the future).

## Implementation Notes

- Use a struct for the queue item (e.g., `result_t` containing job_id and private_key).
- Core 0 should prioritize result submission over checkpoints.

## Testing

- Mock a match and verify Core 0 successfully sends the result to the Master API.
- Use `esp-mock-api` or a custom test script on the master side to verify receipt.
