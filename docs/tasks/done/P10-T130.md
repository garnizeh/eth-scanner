## Description

Allow users to download historical statistics for external processing. This adds buttons to the daily, monthly, and lifetime views to export the currently viewed data.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Add "Export to CSV" and "Export to JSON" buttons to table views.
- [ ] Implement endpoint `GET /api/v1/stats/export?type=csv&view=daily` etc.
- [ ] Set appropriate `Content-Disposition` headers to trigger a browser download.
- [ ] Ensure exports respect any active filters (e.g., date range or worker ID).

## Implementation Notes

- Use Go's `encoding/csv` and `encoding/json` standard libraries.
- For large datasets, stream the results directly to the response writer to minimize memory usage.

## Testing

- Perform exports and open them in Excel/Google Sheets.
- Verify dates and throughput values are correctly formatted in the export.
