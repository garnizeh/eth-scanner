# P09-T080: Benchmark PC worker throughput (keys/sec on reference hardware)

**Phase:** P09 - Integration, Testing & Validation  
**Status:** Completed  
**Priority:** Medium  
**Dependencies:** P06-T110  
**Estimated Effort:** Medium

## Description

Evaluate the performance of the PC Worker implementation on standard hardware to establish expected throughput for the Master API's dynamic batch sizing logic.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Measure throughput (keys per second per CPU core).
- [x] Measure aggregate throughput (all cores used).
- [x] Record results in `docs/worker-pc-benchmarks.md`.
- [x] Update Master API defaults for PC workers if necessary.

## Implementation Notes

- Use reference hardware: Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU E5-2690 v4 @ 2.60GHz (14 Cores / 28 Threads).
- Single-core throughput: ~23,500 keys/sec (with realistic prefix).
- Aggregate throughput: ~270,000 keys/sec (28 threads).
- Increased `maxBatchSize` in server to 4B to accommodate 1-hour batches for PC workers.

## Testing

- Run `go test -v -run=^$ -bench=. -benchmem ./internal/worker`.
