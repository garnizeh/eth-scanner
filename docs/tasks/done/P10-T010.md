# P10-T010: Setup HTMX and Go Template infrastructure with `embed.FS` [COMPLETED]

**Phase:** P10 - Dashboard & Monitoring UI  
**Status:** Completed  
**Priority:** High  
**Dependencies:** None  
**Estimated Effort:** Small

---

## Description

Establish the foundation for the server-side rendered UI. This includes setting up the directory structure, configuring Go's `embed` package to bundle assets, and creating the basic template rendering logic.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Create `go/internal/server/ui/` directory.
- [x] Setup `embed.FS` to include `templates/` and `static/` subdirectories.
- [x] Implement a `TemplateRenderer` or similar helper to load and execute templates from the embedded filesystem.
- [x] Create a "Hello World" dashboard route in `routes.go` to verify the setup.
- [x] Include the HTMX library script in the base layout.

## Implementation Notes

- Use `html/template` for type-safe rendering.
- Templates are loaded at startup and associated with the `base.html` layout.
- Static assets (HTMX, Tailwind, WS) are bundled via `embed` and served via `/static/`.
- Middleware adjusted to allow public access to `/dashboard` and `/static`.

## Testing

- Verified `/dashboard` loads the index template with the base layout.
- Verified `/static/` serves assets correctly from the binary.
- All integration tests pass.
