# P01-T030: Create .gitignore File

**Phase:** P01 - Project Foundation & Setup  
**Status:** Completed  
**Priority:** High  
**Dependencies:** None  
**Estimated Effort:** Small (< 15 minutes)

---

## Description

Create a comprehensive `.gitignore` file at the repository root to exclude build artifacts, compiled binaries, SQLite databases, IDE configuration files, and other generated content from version control.

This prevents accidentally committing sensitive data, build outputs, and IDE-specific files that should remain local to each developer's environment.

---

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] `.gitignore` file exists at repository root
- [x] Go build artifacts are ignored (`*.exe`, `*.dll`, `*.so`, `*.dylib`)
- [x] SQLite database files are ignored (`*.db`, `*.sqlite`, `*.sqlite3`)
- [x] IDE files are ignored (VS Code, GoLand, etc.)
- [x] OS-specific files are ignored (`.DS_Store`, `Thumbs.db`)
- [x] Go vendor and generated code directories are ignored
- [x] File is committed to repository

---

## Implementation Notes

The `.gitignore` was created at the repository root (`/home/user/code/garnizeh/eth-scanner/.gitignore`) and contains patterns to exclude binaries, Go build artifacts, coverage files, SQLite databases, IDE files, environment files, logs, ESP32 build outputs, and temporary files.

---

## Testing

How this was verified:

1. Confirmed the file exists:

   ```bash
   cat .gitignore
   ```

2. Verified common patterns are ignored by creating dummy files and checking `git status` (files like `test.db`, `.env`, `go/bin/master.exe` did not appear as untracked after creating them while `.gitignore` was present).

---

## Completion

- Completed on: 2026-02-14 UTC
- Branch: `task/P01-T030-create-gitignore`
- Commit: `P01-T030: Create .gitignore — complete`

---

## Notes

- Consider committing `sqlc` generated code for easier builds (team preference).
- If using Docker, add Docker-related ignores if needed.
- ESP32 section may need adjustment depending on Arduino IDE vs PlatformIO.
